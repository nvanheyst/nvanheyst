## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a business professional with a passion for the intersection of technology and real-world applications. My interest in robotics and simulation stems from a desire to understand how these technologies can solve practical problems. While I don't come from a traditional programming background and wouldn't call myself a programmer, I enjoy building things and exploring new ideas through code.
